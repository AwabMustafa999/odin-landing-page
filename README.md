MY FIRST REAL PROJECT THROUGH THE TOP CURRICULUM!

- it was fun doing this landing page even though i had some problems but i got it done :).
- fellow top students , please feel free to criticize my work!.
- in this project i made sure to commit as early and often as possiple(one commit per section in the page)and also made sure to use comments in my code to label every section.
